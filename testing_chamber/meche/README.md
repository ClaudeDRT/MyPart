##connector_bulkheads.f3d 
 
Contains bulkheads for the power strip, usb connectors, and vacuum hose. The male thread for all three bulkheads is one mm smaller in diameter (but same pitch) than the female thread on the nut. This lets us 3D print them without having to deal with the shrinking ID/growing OD on 3D prints. Modeling the physical threads is the main reason these files were designed in Fusion 360.

##fan_mount.f3d

File for the plate that the fans will mount to. 


##filter_inlet.f3d

File for the frame for the HEPA filter. 3D modeled as a solid. Construction planes are placed at certain levels to create the dxfs for laser cutting 

##wire_strain_relief_vacuum.f3d

File for a simple plate that the wires from the vacuum relay can be zip tied to. 

##vacuum_cap.ipt

Cap for the vacuum bulkhead designed in vanilla inventor.
