# Software for the Mypart


Contains two folders:
+ production. Contains code that responds to button press, wakes up, samples/calculates, and broadcasts over BLE.
+ tests. Contains tests for each individual peripheral, such as the adc, BLE, or led driver.


All code is currently currently written for the RFDuino (Nordic NRF51822), using the Arduino IDE.
