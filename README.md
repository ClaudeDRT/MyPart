Dependencies:

Python libraries:
time
datetime
os
serial
csv
struct
crc_algorithms
array









USAGE:
1. run sensor_reads.py to take readings from dylos and hhpc sensors
2. comports need to be configured in the globals of sensor_reads.py
3. Proper wiring for HHPC cable:
		_black red green white 
		_ _ yellow _
5. the breathing time for the HHPC is set through the device -- 2.3L = 60seconds


TODO:
1. channel5 on hhpc is 2.0 um, not 2.5 um as the dylos is.  
	find a way to recalibrate that to 2.5
