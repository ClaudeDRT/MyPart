USAGE:
1. run sensor_reads.py to take readings from dylos and hhpc sensors
2. comports need to be configured in the globals of sensor_reads.py
3. Proper wiring for HHPC cable:
		_black red green white 
		_ _ yellow _
4. the dylos will record one read before the HHPC starts, for timing calibration
		when doing data analysis, that reading should be thrown out
5. the breathing time for the HHPC is set through the device -- 2.3L = 60seconds


TODO:
1. channel5 on hhpc is 2.0 um, not 2.5 um as the dylos is.  
	find a way to recalibrate that to 2.5
