# Files for 3D printing the case of the MyPart device


## printing notes
All parts were printed using a Printrbot Simple Metal. 

The fit between the lid and the case is a snap fit using small tabs. Depending on the 3D printer used, the tolerances for the snaps may need to be adjusted.  

analog\_cap and case\_lid were printed in black PLA at 100% fill.
