## General Notes

These toolpaths assume that the sheet material is fixtured using double sided tape.
For the top and bottom air channels, the final cutout is done with an 1/8th end mill before switching to the 1/16th end mill to avoid an extra tool change.
This assumes that the tape on the bottom of the part + the tabs is enough to hold the part stationary during the second milling operation with the 1/16th cutter. 
All parts are milled from 1/4in black ABS, except for the top channel, which is milled from 3/8in black ABS. Check [BOM](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1qyP5fldau5yDtOjCsOBKHUKptpTI_-H6egNNXXvY-Kw/edit?usp=sharing) for details.
